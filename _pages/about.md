Welcome to my website!

I am a linguist currently working at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany. My research interests include historical linguistics, corpus linguistics, cognitive linguistics and construction grammar, first language acquisition, multilingualism, and language evolution research. Here you can find an overview of my work as well as selected materials (e.g., teaching materials and the data my empirical work is based on).

<b>----- Current projects -----</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>German future constructions</b>: How is future reference encoded in historical and present-day German? (Collaborators: Lena Schnee, HHU Düsseldorf; funded by the German research foundation [DFG])</li>
  <li><b>Constructional patterns in multilingual first language acquisition</b>: How can constructional patterns account for code-mixing phenomena in the early language use of bilinguals? (Collaborators: Verena Dederer and Nikolas Koch, LMU Munich, Antje Endesfelder Quick, University of Leipzig; funded by the German Research Foundation [DFG])</li>
  <li><b>Extremist narratives</b>: In the context of the <a href="https://arenasproject.eu/">ARENAS project?</a>, I investigate how extremist narratives manifest linguistically. (Collaborators: Ana Yara Postigo Fuentes, Rolf Kailuweit, Alexander Ziem, HHU Düsseldorf; funded by Horizon 2020)</li>
