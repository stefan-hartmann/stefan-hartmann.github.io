Research data
======

A number of public datasets accompanying my publications can be found on <a href="https://osf.io/7h2yu/">OSF</a>.


Empirical linguistics
======

- Some tutorials on corpus linguistics (most in German, some in English) that I've created can be found <a href="https://empirical-linguistics.github.io/">here</a>.

- Together with Alexander Willich, I have written a tutorial collection (in German) on <a href="https://empirical-linguistics.github.io/ems/">empirical methods for linguistics</a>.

- Some tutorials (also in German) can also be found in the open-source <a href="https://hartmast.github.io/sprachgeschichte/">supplementary material</a> to my 2018 book on German language history.



Teaching
======

I teach a wide variety of topics, from introductory courses to linguistics to more advanced specialized topics as well as workshops on corpus linguistics and statistics. Below are a few collections of materials from my teaching (in German).

- <a href="https://empirical-linguistics.github.io/hist-korpling/">Historische Korpuslinguistik</a>

- <a href="https://empirical-linguistics.github.io/sup/">Semantik und Pragmatik</a>
